## List out the IAM users that accessed an AWS service (successfully or unsuccessfully) in Frothly’s AWS environment?
```sql    
sourcetype="*aws*" *IAM*
```
Check fields. There’s a ```user_type``` field in ```aws:cloudtrail``` with an option for ```IAMUser```:
```SQL    
sourcetype="aws:cloudtrail" user_type="IAMUser"
```
Then check the ```user_type``` field for unique users.
