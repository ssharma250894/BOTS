## 200) List out the IAM users that accessed an AWS service (successfully or unsuccessfully) in Frothly’s AWS environment?

✅ Objective:

Get a list of IAM users that accessed any AWS service, using CloudTrail logs in Splunk. This includes both successful and failed attempts.

🛠️ Query:

This Splunk query identifies all IAM users in Frothly's AWS environment who attempted to access (successfully or not) any AWS service. It leverages the aws:cloudtrail logs to filter only those events initiated by IAM users.

There’s a ```user_type``` field in ```aws:cloudtrail``` with an option for ```IAMUser```:

```SQL    
index="botsv3" sourcetype="aws:cloudtrail" user_type="IAMUser"
```
📌 Breakdown:

```SQL
sourcetype="aws:cloudtrail"
```
→ Filters for events logged by AWS CloudTrail, which records AWS API calls.

```SQL
user_type="IAMUser"
```
→ Narrows results to IAM users only, excluding root, federated, or assumed roles.

Then check the ```user_type``` field for unique users.

🔎 Next Step (Optional):

To get a list of unique IAM users, extend the query:

```SQL
sourcetype="aws:cloudtrail" user_type="IAMUser" | stats count by userIdentity.userName
```
